/* Multi-stage generation: text-to-image keyframes, image-to-video motion,
 * a text-to-speech voiceover, generated ambience, and captions on top.
 *
 *   cp examples/02-genai.tsx ~/Projects/genai/index.tsx
 *   dapi open ~/Projects/genai
 *
 * `generate.*` declarations are pure values; nothing generates until commit.
 * Refs form a dependency graph (keyframe -> matching second keyframe -> two
 * motion clips) that generates in topological order, blocking the command
 * until every asset lands. <captions> reads the finished scene audio after
 * generation, so caption timing matches the voiceover. Consumes credits;
 * results are cached in the project's library, so re-mounting unchanged
 * specs is free.
 * Discover models and voices with `dapi models <type>` and `dapi voices`;
 * omitted here, so each stage uses the default model.
