# Strokes, shadows and effects

Three sub-entity children a node takes alongside its [paints](./paints.md): an outline of its shape, a shadow beneath it, and a filter over what it drew. Each stacks in document order, several of a kind are allowed, and each carries an `id` of its own — the editor writes a changed value back to the element that spelled it, and it is copied with its node.

```tsx
<text fontSize={140} fontWeight="bold" color="#FFFFFF" width={1920} textAlign="center">
  Headline
  <stroke color="#000000" width={6} join="round" />
  <shadow color="#000000" blur={24} offsetY={8} opacity={0.6} />
</text>
```

## `<stroke>`

An outline of the parent's box — or of its glyphs, on a `<text>` or a `<textRange>`. `color`/`opacity` are its paint, the rest its line style.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ------- |
| `color` | `string` | **required** | Any CSS color; alpha is ignored (use `opacity`). |
| `width` | `number` | `1` | Line width, px. A `width` [keyframe track](./keyframes.md) under a stroke drives this, not a box. |
| `join` | `"miter" \| "round" \| "bevel"` | `"miter"` | How the stroke turns corners. |
| `cap` | `"butt" \| "round" \| "square"` | `"butt"` | How the stroke ends open paths (text glyphs). |
| `miterLimit` | `number` | `10` | Miter length limit, as a ratio of the width. |
| `opacity` | `number` | `1` | `0`–`1`. |
| `blendMode` | `BlendMode` | `"sourceOver"` | How the stroke composites. |
| `hidden` | `boolean` | absent | Excludes the stroke without removing it. |

## `<shadow>`

A drop shadow beneath the parent's silhouette: a blurred, offset copy of it in `color`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ------- |
| `color` | `string` | **required** | Any CSS color. |
| `blur` | `number` | `0` | Blur radius, px. |
| `offsetX`, `offsetY` | `number` | `0` | Where the shadow sits relative to the silhouette, px. |
| `opacity` | `number` | `1` | `0`–`1`. |
| `hidden` | `boolean` | absent | Excludes the shadow without removing it. |

## `<effect>`

A filter over the parent's **rendered pixels** — its fills, strokes and children together. On a [`<group>`](./group.md) that is the group as a whole; on a [`<video>`](./video.md) it is the frame after the media is drawn. A [`<mask>`](#mask) child limits where the effect applies.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ------- |
| `type` | `EffectType` | **required** | Which filter to apply, see below. |
| `value` | `number` | **required** | The amount. |
| `hidden` | `boolean` | absent | Excludes the effect without removing it. |

| `type` | `value` means |
| ------ | ------------- |
| `"blur"` | Radius in px of the node, so it holds at any preview zoom or export resolution. |
| `"pixelate"` | Block size in px of the node; `1` or less is off. The blocks sit on the node's box and turn with it. |
| `"hueRotate"` | Degrees. |
| `"brightness"`, `"contrast"`, `"grayscale"`, `"invert"`, `"saturate"`, `"sepia"` | Amount, `0`–`1`. |
| `"opacity"` | The node's opacity as an effect, `0`–`1`. With a `<mask>` under it, what is outside the mask goes transparent: the cut-out. |

```tsx
<image src="stills/photo.jpg" width={1920} height={1080}>
  <effect type="blur" value={0}>
    <keyframeTrack property="value">
      <keyframe time={0} value={40} easing="easeOut" />
      <keyframe time={1.5} value={0} />
    </keyframeTrack>
  </effect>
</image>
```


## `<mask>`

A matte limiting the `<effect>` holding it: a **picture** whose alpha says where the effect applies, fitted into the node's box the way the node fits its footage. It is what the editor's object mask tool makes — pick an object in a video clip, track it, and the frames it found are written to the library and named by `src`. In PureCut only the tool makes them; the drawer agent can reuse a mask file but not track one. Several under one effect intersect. Without a `src` a `<mask>` does nothing.

Under an `"opacity"` effect the mask is the cut-out: the clip shows inside the mask and goes transparent outside, as a mask on Premiere's Opacity does. Under any other effect the effect shows through inside the mask and the picture is untouched outside: an inverted mask on a `"blur"` blurs the background behind a person.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ------- |
| `src` | `string` | none | The frames: a `.mask` file from the object mask tool, or a directory of numbered images whose alpha is the mask. |
| `sourceIn` | `Time` | `0` | The node's source time the first frame belongs to, so the mask stays on the footage it was made from whatever the trim. |
| `frameRate` | `number` | `30` | Frames per second the frames were written at (the composition's). |
| `blur` | `number` | `0` | Feather: radius in px the edge falls off over. |
| `opacity` | `number` | `1` | How strongly the mask limits the effect. `1` stops the effect at the edge; lower lets that much of it through outside; `0` is no mask. |
| `inverted` | `boolean` | `false` | Covers what the picture does not instead. |
| `smoothing` | `number` | `0.25` | How much a mask file's edge is smoothed, `0`–`1`. At `0` it is exactly where the model put it; the more, the rounder, and the more of what is thin or small melts away. Sharp at any size either way. |
| `follow` | `string` | none | The `id` of a video clip whose subject this is: the frames are placed in that clip's box, with its transform and fit, and timed by its source time instead of the node's. While the clip is not playing the mask covers nothing. |
| `hidden` | `boolean` | absent | Switches the mask off without removing it. |

`blur` and `opacity` take a [`<keyframeTrack>`](./keyframes.md).

```tsx
<video src="footage/skater.mp4" width={1920} height={1080}>
  <effect type="opacity" value={1}>
    <mask src="masks/skater" sourceIn={2} frameRate={30} blur={6} />
  </effect>
</video>
```

**Privacy blur.** A `"blur"` or `"pixelate"` effect with a mask blurs only the tracked object — a face, a plate, a screen — for the whole clip:

```tsx
<video id="street" src="footage/street.mp4" width={1920} height={1080}>
  <effect type="pixelate" value={24}>
    <mask src="masks/street/Tracking 1.mask" />
  </effect>
</video>
```

**Behind the subject.** A text (or any node) above a clip, with an inverted mask that follows the clip under an `"opacity"` effect, is cut away where the subject is, so the subject stands in front of it and the rest of the frame stays behind it:

```tsx
<video id="talk" src="footage/talk.mp4" width={1920} height={1080} />
<text id="title" x={200} y={300} fontSize={280}>
  BIG IDEAS
  <effect type="opacity" value={1}>
    <mask src="masks/talk/Tracking 1.mask" follow="talk" inverted />
  </effect>
</text>
```

The subject shows through from the clip below, so anything drawn between the clip and the text is cut away with it.

## Animating them

All three take [`<keyframeTrack>`](./keyframes.md) children, and the track's `property` is read against its holder: `width` under a `<stroke>` is the line width, `blur` / `offsetX` / `offsetY` under a `<shadow>` are the shadow's, `value` under an `<effect>` is its amount, and `color` / `opacity` are whatever the holder's are.
