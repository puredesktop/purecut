# `<stage>`

The infinite canvas every project renders into: the **root element**, and the only thing that may be one. It holds [`<scene>`](./scene.md) children — one per frame you cut in — and, alongside them, loose nodes parked on the canvas.

```tsx
export default function Project() {
  return (
    <stage background="#161616" camera={[0.16, 0, 0, 0.16, 50, 230]}>
      <scene name="Intro" width={1920} height={1080} fill="black" active>{/* ... */}</scene>
      <scene name="Outro" x={2120} width={1920} height={1080} fill="black">{/* ... */}</scene>
    </stage>
  );
}
```

A node at root level is material rather than composition: a generated clip that has not been cut into a scene yet, a reference still lying about. It draws on the canvas and can be dragged, selected and inspected, but it has no scene's clock to be placed against, so it plays nothing and exports nowhere — that is what moving it into a scene is for. It is where the editor puts what it generates.

The stage is a **singleton**: it is the canvas already on screen rather than something the project creates, so a project spelling `<stage>` addresses the one that is there. One mount per world — a save disposes the running mount before the new one takes the stage, and the scenes it owned go with it.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ------- |
| `background` | `string` | `#161616` | Canvas color behind the scenes, any CSS color. Not part of a render: it is what surrounds the frame, not what is in it. |
| `camera` | `[a, b, c, d, e, f]` | `[0.3, 0, 0, 0.3, 85, 150]` | The editor's viewport when the project is opened, as a 2D affine matrix in the order CSS `matrix()` and canvas `setTransform` take: `a`/`d` scale, `b`/`c` skew, `e`/`f` translate. |

Both are editor state rather than composition: nothing rendered or exported depends on either, but the source is the document, so a panned canvas has nowhere else to be written back to. A project that never says where to look opens framed on a 1920×1080 frame at the origin, roughly centered in a default window — so a single landscape scene at `x={0} y={0}` needs no camera. Write one when the composition is anything else: a portrait or unusual format, a scene placed away from the origin, or several scenes side by side.

The matrix that frames a scene sitting at the origin is `[s, 0, 0, s, x, y]`: `s` scales the frame to fit the canvas — roughly 750×620 CSS pixels in a default window — and `x`/`y` inset it from the corner. A landscape frame around 580 px wide, a portrait one around 480 px tall, leaves room for the scene's label above it and the floating toolbar below:

| Scene | Camera |
| ----- | ------ |
| 1920×1080 | `[0.3, 0, 0, 0.3, 85, 150]` |
| 1080×1920 | `[0.25, 0, 0, 0.25, 235, 70]` |
| 960×540 | `[0.6, 0, 0, 0.6, 85, 150]` |

Nothing depends on the exact numbers — the viewport is whatever size the window is, and the first pan or zoom overwrites them. They only have to open on the composition rather than beside it. With more than one scene on the canvas, scale to span them all (see the example above) or frame the [active](./scene.md) one.

The stage takes no timing, no transform and no paints — it is not a node, it is where the nodes are.

## Canvas placement

A root's place on the canvas is its own `x`/`y`, in the same document space the camera matrix moves through. Roots that do not say where they sit all sit at the origin, on top of each other; give each after the first an `x` clear of the ones before it, as the example above does.

Which scene the playhead, the timeline and [`capture`](../tools/capture.md) are pointed at is a scene's `active`, not the stage's business. At most one scene carries it, and only a direct child of `<stage>` can.
