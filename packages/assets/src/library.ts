// The asset library of a project: the manifest, loaded with handles attached,
// plus everything that changes it — imports, renames, folders, generated
// output — and the one place a `src` is turned into an asset. Files the user
// imports stay where they are (the manifest links to them by absolute path);
// only bytes the app itself produces are written into the project's
// `assets/` directory, and anything found there that the manifest does not
// know is taken into the library. What is derived from assets and worth
// keeping (thumbnails, waveforms) is the `cache`'s, under `cache/`.
//
// Knows nothing of the host: files come and go through a `ProjectFS`, and
// what it cannot do itself (follow a rename into whatever names assets by
// path, rebind whatever is bound to a relinked asset's old id) it asks of
// `LibraryOptions`. Generation is not its business either — a generated
// file is stored like any other bytes the app produced, with its
// `generation` record along — but where a generation stands is: a run that
// has started is a partial document here (`reserve`), one that failed stays
// as one with its reason (`fail`), and one that landed replaces its partial
// (`store`). Its state is solid signals (`assets()`, `partials()`,
// `folders()`), so readers inside a tracking scope follow it.
