// On entities a `<For>`/`<Index>` body produced: the source of that loop (see

// bumping the seed transcribes the scene again. Seed 0 is the default take.

// On an element authored with `syncTo`: the id of the element to align
// against by listening instead of arithmetic. The asset system waits for both
// sides' assets to land, cross-correlates the two recordings, and derives
// Delay/Trim so they coincide on the timeline. Stands (with PendingSync) as a
// pending source, so a transcription of the scene waits for the clip to land
// where it will play. Never serialized, for the same reason the requests
// above are not.
export const SyncRequest = trait({ value: '' });

// a result that arrives after the element was pointed at another target (or
// none) is dropped. The document clears it whenever a new syncTo arrives.

// (or none) is dropped. The document clears it whenever a new src arrives.

// Why the entity's src never became an asset: the message of the rejection
// the asset system saw. Session state, like the requests above: it stands
// until a resolution for the src starts again, and is never written back to
// the source. What outlives the session is the library's: a generation that
// failed stands there as a partial document carrying this same message, and
// answers the next request for it with the failure rather than another run.
//
// `generated` tells a failed generation from a failed load, for whoever
// reports them: the one is a model refusing or a spec a model cannot take,
// the other a path that is not there.

// path from the mount root), so a re-run in adopt mode can bind to the
// existing entity instead of minting a new one.

// is either a standalone TRANSCRIPT asset or embedded in an AUDIO/VIDEO
// asset, referenced via AssetId.
