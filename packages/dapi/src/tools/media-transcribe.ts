Search the file for the passage you need (grep, jq) rather than reading it whole: a long recording's word timings run to tens of thousands of tokens. Commonly useful for footage with speakers (talking head, interview), where the word times let you cut on a line. A transcript marks only speech; the gaps are not necessarily silent (music, score, applause).",
