By default the frames are merged into contact sheets: up to 12 per image, each cell labelled with its timecode (`08s10f`, zero segments dropped) and drawn as large as fits, so a handful of frames arrives as one high-resolution picture instead of a directory to open one by one (separate: true writes a PNG per frame). Grabs the asset's own pixels, unlike capture which renders the composited node. The recommended tool for understanding a video at the frame level; past ~12 frames prefer media_filmstrip.",
